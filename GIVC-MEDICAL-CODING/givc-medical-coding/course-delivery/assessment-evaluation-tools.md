## Assessment Tools Library

### 1. Knowledge Check Tools

#### Quick Poll Templates
**Multiple Choice Polls (2-3 minutes)**
```
Question: Which Arabic term correctly represents "acute myocardial infarction"?
A) احتشاء عضلة القلب المزمن
B) احتشاء عضلة القلب الحاد ✓
C) التهاب عضلة القلب الحاد
D) ذبحة صدرية حادة

Immediate Feedback: 
- Correct: "Excellent! 'الحاد' means acute, and 'احتشاء' specifically refers to infarction."
- Incorrect: "Remember that 'احتشاء' (infarction) is different from 'التهاب' (inflammation)."
```

#### True/False with Explanation
```
Statement: "ICD-10-AM is the official diagnosis coding system used in Saudi Arabia."
Answer: True ✓

Explanation: Saudi Arabia officially adopted ICD-10-AM (Australian Modification) for diagnosis coding, replacing the previous ICD-10-CM system to align with their healthcare infrastructure.

Follow-up Question: "What does the 'AM' in ICD-10-AM stand for?"
```

#### Ranking/Priority Exercises
```
Rank the following coding steps in the correct order:
□ Review medical documentation
□ Identify principal diagnosis
□ Apply coding guidelines
□ Verify code accuracy
□ Submit codes for billing

Correct Order: 1→2→3→4→5
Rationale: Proper coding workflow ensures accuracy and compliance.
